# Revco Spec

## What is Revco?
Revco is an open source web application to allow developers to get feedback on code being used in open source projects.

## Why Revco?
Revco will aim to encourage collaboration and provide much needed exposure to new projects, strengthening the open source eco-system.

## How will it work?
People will be able to submit projects, combined with a set of tags and a description where Revco will analyse it by language and recommend it to be "reviewed" by a number of individuals. In order to keep the eco-system alive projects will be exposed to different amounts of individuals based on the "activity" of their key contributors (and/or submitter).

## What will the challenges of Revco be?
As Revco is a social application it will face a "chicken or the egg" issue, where in order to create interest in the site activity will also have to be happening concurrently. Engaging users and creating a desire to review more projects is key as well.
