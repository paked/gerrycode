# Gerrycode Spec

## What is GerryCode?
Gerrycode is an open source web application to allow developers to get feedback on code being used in open source projects.

## Why Gerrycode?
Gerrycode will aim to encourage collaboration and provide much needed exposure to new projects, strengthening the open source eco-system.

## How will it work?
People will be able to submit projects, combined with a set of tags and a description where Gerrycode will analyse it by language and recommend it to be "reviewed" by a number of individuals. In order to keep the eco-system alive projects will be exposed to different amounts of individuals based on the "activity" of their key contributors (and/or submitter).

It could kind of be like a Quora for code review...

## What will the challenges of Gerrycode be?
As Gerrycode is a social application it will face a "chicken or the egg" issue, where in order to create interest in the site activity will also have to be happening concurrently. Engaging users and creating a desire to review more projects is key as well.

## Notes
* Users registers a project from their github
* Flags parts of the projects for review
* Users are "suggested" to work on the project by an automated system
* Reviews are done, either in a fork or as a comment
* User gives feedback on the comment
* ...something happens to the flag at some point to remove it...
* Wash rinse repeat!


## What is a project??
* A project is a published git repo on revco.
* Projects are reviewed when a creator (or someone else) flags them
* Various amounts of feedback are given, and after a calculated amount of views or reviews the flag is closed
